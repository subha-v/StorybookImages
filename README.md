This project takes a storybook in English and converts it into a multilingual book by resizing the images and text

Steps to Using: 

1. Obtain pdf of the English version of the book you would like to use
2. Remove the cover and other random pages at the back of the book that don't need to be translated - I use the website: https://smallpdf.com/delete-pages-from-pdf
3. Convert the pdf into a series of images - https://pdftoimage.com/
4. Rename the pages to page-001, etc. (WILL IMPLEMENT AUTO RENAMING LATER)
5. Use https://pdfcandy.com/extract-images.html to extract the images into a folder
